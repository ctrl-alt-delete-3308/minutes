## Project Milestone 5 Next Up

Ryan couldn't attend.

Rhett, Michael, Kenny went over current site functionality, Django overiew and file description, reviewed Twitter integration with ptython files and views. We also compiled a list of remaining tasks to complete.

## TODO

List:
1 For Ryan - get site hosted fully
2 For Rhett - Twitter divide by zero error (But everyone working with an api needs to have a graceful way of telling the user no results were found)
3 For Michael - YouTube, Reddit search functionality.
4 For Kenny - Instagram search functionality.
5 Format search bar on home page.
6 format text on search results page.
7 add past searches to user account page. (I would love to have the past searches plus their positive, negative, and neutral scores displayed on the account page, but we would have to start saving those to our database and then access theem on the user page. None of that has been done.)
8 redo the "About Pulse" page so it doesn't look like trash.
9 start testing site (try to break it, then fix)

##Regarding Django

Need to install to run: python3, django, crispy_forms, tweepy, textblob
To create superuser (admin access): python3 manage.py createsuperuser
to access admin site, once hosted add '/admin' to end of URL. Text Rhett your username and he can add a tab for you for easy access.
to run server: python3 manage.py runserver
url for site will be listed in terminal after running server, but should be: 'http://localhost:8000/'
