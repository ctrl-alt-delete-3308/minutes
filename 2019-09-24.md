## Project Milestone 1

Worked through PM1, each taking on a section and brainstorming as a team how we were going to go about each part of the document. Definitely feel solid about what we are starting with. Additionally, Michael set our team's logo today in Github which looks awesome.

## GitKraken

Started working with GitKraken:

* Got most of our team joined into our board.
* Created columns within our Kanban board.
* Populated with initial list of tasks.

## Next Meeting 

Set an objective to continue filling out our board until Friday's meeting. We had an idea today that during Friday's meeting we'd review the tasks in the board and brainstorm other tasks we can add to start building up our project requirements.
