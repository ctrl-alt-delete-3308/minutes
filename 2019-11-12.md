## Project Milestone 5 Next Up (22nd, I think)
*Bad traffic, everyone was late. Kenny couldn't make it.

## Rhett created a django project to host our site. Integrated with the html he had already made.
*Site can no be locally hosted.
*User database set up, can create, delete, modify users etc.
*Search history database set up, each search tied to a specific user.
*Got the front end working with the backend python code for twitter searching with the api.
*Display results now fully functional with twitter data.
*Reddit and YouTube support to come, but I did fill it with elizabeth warren posts just to fill the space and so we can see what the final product will look like.
*We are pretty close to being totally done at this point.

## Next up:
* Reddit support (Michael)
* YouTube support (Michael)
* Analytics graphics automatically displayed (Rhett will look into css/javascript libraries for this)
* Site crashes when a search is performed and user is not logged in, hide search bar unless signed in.
* Host site on linux server (Ryan)
