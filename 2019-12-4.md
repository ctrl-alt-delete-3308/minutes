## Project Milestone 6 Next Up

Michael, Kenny couldn't attend.

Rhett, Ryan worked on live version of the site. Cookies issue keeping the login from working right now. Figured out how to create a super user on current setup.

## TODO List:
* For Rhett - add logos to site for presentation
* For Ryan - fix bugs on live site regarding users and cookies
* For Michael - integrate reddit and youtube support
* Google Doc started which details what we will talk about during the presentation. Everyone needs to add their part.

## Was completed:
* Rhett and Ryan completed Project Milestone 5
* Ryan got live version of site up

## Regarding Django

* Need to install to run: python3, django, crispy_forms, tweepy, textblob
* To create superuser (admin access): python3 manage.py createsuperuser to access admin site, once hosted add '/admin' to end of URL. Text Rhett your username and he can add a tab for you for easy access.
* to run server: python3 manage.py runserver
* url for site will be listed in terminal after running server, but should be: 'http://localhost:8000/'
