## Project Milestone 5 Next Up

Michael couldn't attend.

Rhett, Ryan, Kenny ...

## From last week:
* Rhett - reformatted search bar, fixed divide by zero crash error, made sure all text was the same,
performed many tests, twitter gracefully displays message that no tweets were found if none were obtained by the api, did the same for the analytics.
* Ryan - worked on server stuff.

## TODO List:
* For Rhett - Done with everything he is going to work on.
* For Michael - YouTube and Reddit search functionality.
* For Ryan - get hosted.
* For Kenny - add new feature, get started and integrate.
* add past searches to user account page. (I would love to have the past searches plus their positive, negative, and neutral scores displayed on the account page, but we would have to start saving those to our database and then access them on the user page. None of that has been done.)
* redo the "About Pulse" page so it doesn't look like trash.
* continue testing site (try to break it, then fix)


## Regarding Django

* Need to install to run: python3, django, crispy_forms, tweepy, textblob
* To create superuser (admin access): python3 manage.py createsuperuser to access admin site, once hosted add '/admin' to end of URL. Text Rhett your username and he can add a tab for you for easy access.
* to run server: python3 manage.py runserver
* url for site will be listed in terminal after running server, but should be: 'http://localhost:8000/'
