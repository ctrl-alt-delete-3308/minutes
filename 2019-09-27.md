## Brainstorming/Ideas

Want to nail down specifics.

* Save searches and tie them to accounts for researching.
  * Save compiled results as a pdf that we can shoot out, to account for changes in time
  * Can also just save searches to do updated results
  * Save top stuff and analytical data (aggregations/summaries) but not all data.
  * for saving, don't want the results page to be too interactive so we can save the results page
    as directly as possible.
* Page layout
  * A page consists of widgets
  * Each widget has a subset of analytical information, colors, design, size, etc.
  * Page will layout the widges
  * widget -> layout -> page
  * Wish list would be have selectable search criteria and auto layout depending on certain
    parameters.
* Backend Implementation (created chart on lucidchart)
  * We know we want a scraper which will gather data that a user requests through APIs
  * We know we want a way to store data so we can save searches and account data
  * We know we want a way (wishlist) to query data to get trends
  * We know we want a way to queue requests
  * This leads to three components:
    * pub/sub for queueing requests (redis?)
    * custom scraper for pulling api data (python/logstash?)
    * storage that can perform storage and trend queries (elasticsearch)
