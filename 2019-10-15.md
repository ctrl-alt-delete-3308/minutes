## Project Milestone 2 now posted. Finalizing Features in preparation.

##Recap of research from 10/10:
*Rhett
  *Twint - experienced some serious difficulties getting this working becasue of some Omptimus/Spark issues.
* Ryan
  *Server - made good progress getting it set up. He is using Google Cloud Compute.

##Continued Research Topics (for discussion Friday):
  *Rhett
    *Found a similar service here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-python/  I will try to get it working with Twint instead of the dev api. Else we can just use that as-is.
  *Ryan
    *Should hopefully get the VPN running so that we are each able to ssh in.
  *Kenny
    *Python client for Instagram so that we are able to manipulate and use the data we obtain from the APIs.
  *Michael
    *Python client for Reddit/Youtube so that we are able to manipulate and use the data we obtain from the APIs.
