## Project Milestone 2 now posted. Finalizing Features in preparation.

##Recap of research from 10/2:
*Rhett
  *Twitter API - should work great. We will use the Twitter Search API specifically.
  *Facebook API - Facebook Graph API will likely not work. Too user specific, requires access token acquired through login.
  *Twint will work great for Twitter opinion analytics I think.
* Ryan
  *LinkedIn - no good.
  *TikTok - could work but may not be worth the effort.
* Kenny
  *Instagram API - we should be able to work with Instagram.
* Michael
  *Reddit - we should be able to work with Reddit.

##Continued Research Topics (for discussion next week):
  *Rhett
    *Twint - going to try and get it running on my local machine.
  *Michael
    *YouTube API, Possible News API.
  *Ryan
    *Try to get server set up with his own machinery.
